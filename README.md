This project showcases the development and implementation of a relational database using SQL, focusing on creating a robust and efficient database schema. The script includes all necessary instructions to set up the database, from defining tables and relationships to populating them with sample data. Designed with scalability and data integrity in mind, the database utilizes primary and foreign keys, constraints, and normalization techniques to ensure consistent and reliable data storage.

Users can leverage the provided SQL script to create the database on any standard SQL database management system, such as MySQL. Once set up, the database can be queried using the predefined SQL commands in the script, making it ideal for exploring data relationships, running analytics, and understanding database management principles. Additionally, the structure is designed to be adaptable, allowing users to expand or modify it to suit specific project requirements.
